# courseTracker
This was my first experience with Python. This code was written for a small coding contest during the summer.
The application had to be completed in three days. The program requires Tkinter and BeautifulSoup4.
The application pulls all of the courses offered by Tulsa University for 2016. It then divides them all up based on department. The goal of the project was to be able to search all of the courses offered to find a course that suits the students desired needs (department, course level, start and end time, etc.) My team did not complete the program. However, we did end up winning the competition because of our idea and completion of the application in comparison to other teams. What needs to be completed is the filtering functions.
I left the program in the state that won the competition. The last I checked, the program still runs off of the same URLs, but if Tulsa University ever takes down the websites, then the program will not work correctly.
